# Usage

```

# Note

The app supports displaying custom statistics for your friends. To use this feature,
create a file named `friends.json` in the CWD, with the following contents:

```javascript
{
    "<Full name>": {
        "ID": "<String>",
        "alternateNames": ["<String>", "<String>", ...]
    },
    ...
}
```

The program will successfully parse the JSON data and give the corresponding
details from the passed spreadsheet. You can pass any name inside `alternateNames`
when prompted, instead of typing the ID everytime.
